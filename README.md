Project Overview
The flask-todolist is a simple web application built with Flask that allows users to manage their to-do items. The core purpose of this repository is to serve as a practical environment for identifying and remediating common web application vulnerabilities, particularly those found in Python applications.

Features
Basic To-Do list functionality (add, view, delete items).

Designed to include examples of common security flaws (e.g., hardcoded credentials, SQL injection possibilities, etc.) for educational purposes.

Demonstrates the use of security linters/scanners like Bandit.

Getting Started
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

Prerequisites
Python 3.x

pip (Python package installer)

git

Installation
Clone the repository:

Bash

git clone https://github.com/your-username/secure-code-review-flask-todolist.git
cd secure-code-review-flask-todolist
(Note: Replace your-username with the actual GitHub username or organization if this project is hosted elsewhere. If this is a local setup for learning, you can omit the https://github.com/your-username/ part and just work with the local directory.)

Create and activate a virtual environment (recommended):

Bash

python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
Install the required dependencies:

Bash

pip install -r requirements.txt
Install Bandit (for security analysis):

Bash

pip install bandit
Running the Application
Ensure your virtual environment is activated.

Set the Flask application environment variable:

Bash

export FLASK_APP=app.py
Run the Flask application:

Bash

flask run
The application will typically be accessible at http://127.0.0.1:5000/.

Code Review and Security Analysis
This project is intended for practicing code review and security analysis. You are encouraged to identify and fix the vulnerabilities present in the codebase.

Using Bandit
Bandit is a security linter for Python code. It's pre-configured to detect common security issues.

To run Bandit on the project:

Bash

bandit -r .
To run Bandit and output the report to a file:

Bash

bandit -r -o bandit_report.txt -f txt
Expected (initial) findings might include issues like B106:hardcoded_password_funcarg as seen in the provided screenshots, indicating hardcoded passwords in function arguments.
